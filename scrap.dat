	<name>Elyptica Spaceport Hall 1</name>
	<summary>
		The white, austere halls are bustling with people.
		They are a hallmark of Martian technology and progress-
		The beauty and vigor of it's architecture juxtaposited with
		the height of engineering technology of the late space age.
		It fills you with determination and hope for the future as
		quickly as it frequently snatches it away upon thought of the
		many social perils that lie murmering below it's placid surface.

		The singularity, by definition, was to be an era afterwhich
		society before couldn't- and hadn't planned for. Nobody had
		imagined it would be quite so bland. Perhaps it had been gutted.
		Perhaps Moore's law wasn't nearly as much of a law as some had
		hoped.

		Your thoughts are interrupted as a space cruiser lands in a terminal
		near you. That rattling makes your estachuarine fluid rattle in
		your ears.
