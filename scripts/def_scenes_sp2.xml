		<summary>Valles Marineris is easily one of the most striking sites you've ever seen. The bottom of your Redwater hovers above a staggering drop to the Martian surface below. Marineris was home to one of humanity's first colonies on this planet, and there are many settlements there to this day. Your ship requests to know where you would like to go next, of the plethora of options available.</summary>
