		<summary>
			You stumble out of your shuttle into the Elyptica spaceport. It was a rough ride.

			You should get your bearings and figure out how to get out of this joint.
		</summary>
		<ambient>You shuffle restlessly under the somewhat dim electric lights.</ambient>

		<summary>
			It wasn't very hard to find the bustling, central core of the spaceport.
			This place must be small.
			Around you are a number of shops, as well as halls to all the terminals.
		</summary>
		<ambient>The bustle makes you nervous, but the food in the shops makes you salivate.</ambient>
