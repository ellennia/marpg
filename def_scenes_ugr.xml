		You are in an ominous-feeling cavern.
		A quick flash of your flashlight indicates that this is red rock.
		Unsurprising- you didn't figure that you magially somehow got off of Mars.

		You appear in a large cavern with a massive gash in the floor.
		It's full of water.
		How did water get in here, in a cavern under the surface of Mars?
		Nobody fucking knows.

		So, you went and did it. You jumped in.
		You can barely see anything because of how murky the waters around you are.
		There's a rumbling noise below you. It gives you a chill.
		<ambient>You remember you need to breathe soon.</ambient>
